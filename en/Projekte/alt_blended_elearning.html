					<h2>Blended Elearning-course Audio Videotechnik (ESF Project)</h2>
					
					<h3>Goal</h3>
										
					<p>
						An Internet-based course should be developed and carried out which enabled the participants to understand modern digital audio and video technologies and to apply. The participants should be moved into the position to react with the help of the learnt technologies adaptably and competently to the new requirements of the media society. The transmission of the teaching contents should occur blended learning draught after to a prevailing part Internet-supported asynchronously and synchronically, i.e. the participants should be able to call away the teaching unities asynchronously in her company or at home on Internet take part during the presence arrangements actively.
					</p>
					<p>
						The physical presence of the the participants in the college should be held taking into account the possible occupation low. Presence duty in the college was planned only for the common final presentation / achievement control of the projects.
					</p>

					<h3>Development and implementation</h3>
					
					<p>
						The implemention was subdevided into development and implementation phase.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						In the development stage the teaching and learning materials were provided. 8 theoretical teaching unities to 2 time unities were defined and fortified with macromedia-editor "Dreamweaver" written animations and pictures so that they could be put as HTML material in the Intranet.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The development stage was made up of a theoretical part of 16 unities in which basis knowledge is given. That is it were provided two unities with the following subjects:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Bases digital picture models, digitization</li>
						<li>Picture perception (bases light and colour)</li>
						<li>Colourmodels</li>
						<li>Digital image editing</li>
						<li>picture compression (lossy and lossless)</li>
						<li>Video coding</li>
						<li>Bases audiotechnology</li>
						<li>Audio compression</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						After production of the HTML materials the teaching unities were still produced in addition as an audio / video lecture and the HTML materials were dynamically taped with especially developed software digitally with. This puts out the specific specific feature of the course. In this manner the material could be provided in triple form: as a pure HTLM document, as an audio stream video stream infers with the dynamic text document and as an audio infers with the dynamic text document.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						This allows it to the users the material according to demand and available tape-wide Internet to make available.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The access to the Internet materials occurred about an Internet platform specially furnished for it which as an access control, as well as a chat platform for the participants served. It was extensively used. Beside the theoretical materials numerous additional practical instructions and information were also provided to in practical exercises used cut software &quot;Adobe première&quot; on the platform.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						After the materials were produced, the realisation phase occurred.
This existed of the presentation of the theoretical material. Beside the supply in the net it was reported also by presence meetings and from practical exercises by a total of 16 unities in those the learnt knowledge was moved and applied. That is the contact with digital / analogous cameras or other video / audio springs, also were learnt Digitize, reaping, modifying and joining the audio / video signals in a computer to a coherent video clip.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						4 courses found up to now it in the time of 2002-2004 with an average of 15 participants. Another free-financed course is planned. The acceptance of the arrangement and the material by the participants was very good excluding like the evaluation.
