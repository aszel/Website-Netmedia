					<h2>FPGA-Design with VHDL and Simulink</h2>
					
					<h3>Short summary</h3>
					
					<p>
						With this application the FHTW applies a further education course  for engineers, technicians and scientists to provide them a trainig in modern, simulate-based methods of development for circuits with FPGSs (Field Programmable Gate Array).
					</p>
					<p>
					 A FPGA is a configurable digital integrated circuit (IC) which functionality is based on a kind of programming. Due to a specific configuration of intern structures it is possible to implement simple flip-flops or counters up to high complex circuits like signal processors combined in a circuit. By now FPGAs are used in all areas of digital technology. They offer special advantages in case of multiple reconfigurations of components without changing their hardware structure. This point is important in development of prototypes or small series-production. So FPGAs are a cheap alternative to manufacturers of semiconductor technology.
					</p>
					<p>
						The special feature here is the use of new software methods, which allows the generation of prototypes directly from the system simulation environment with an FPGA. This is for companies, which use digital electronics in their products, to reduce development time to market decisively. It is understood that thus the circle of dedicated workers who are affected by unemployment or threatened, an entry in an interesting and forward-looking field of work is given and an upgrading of relevant employees already achieved. 
					</p>
					
					<h3>How and by what methods should this goal be achieved?</h3>
					<p>
						The resulting course covers all steps from the system simulation until building a prototype. 	
The measure is divided into two parts. In the first part customized multimedia work materials will be created to build a sustainable course programme. The laborative part should take a large part in training units, it should be able to consider the concerns of companies targeted has taken place. To this end, a library of various functions with this FPGA tool should be created, which also is available for course participants. In the second part this course will be performed and integrated in the range of FHTW-training opportunities.
					</p>
					<p>
						With the help of a scientific employee the applicants
						<ul>
							<li>develop electronic documentaion for this couse</li>
							<li>create teaching examples</li>
							<li>create a module library</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<p>
					<h3>What should like to be achieved?</h3>
					</p>
					<p>
						Chances originate from the application of this new methodology for new workplaces, in particular by with it linked expansion of product spectra which can be equipped with the help of this design methodology with better electronics, however, also the possibilities of existence foundations and services offer in the area of the digital electronics design.
					</p>
					<p>
						The establishment of a course at the FHTW appears as an ideal base for training in this methodology. On the one hand practise-experienced instructors exist who apply this technology already for many years in her projects, and on the other hand has the FHTW a high competence degree for the realisation of continuing education offers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Berlin FHTW maintains narrow contacts to the industry and to service providers as well as to users of the electronics technology. Thus cooperations with companies exist by which practically oriented and to the market oriented education is promoted. Cooperations with companies to concrete projects are planned. In the end, the companies which deliver the necessary software will also support this plan. (see LOI).
					</p>
					<p>
						Computers Aided design (CAD) and computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) stamp the work of the engineer.The contact with these programs can be learnt only about the practical work. Hence, the programs Matlab and Simulink are introduced here and introduced in the work with Simulink. This is built up gradually so that at first the elementary simulation functions are learnt afterwards the inclusion of the periphery and after that the special contact with the FPGAs on which the ready simulation model is loaded.
					</p>
					<p>
						This assumes teaching material qualitatively of high standing which must be made specially for these courses, then can be used, however, also with lasting effect.
					</p>
					<p>
						On account of the importance of the used materials for an efficient education a subdivision of the whole project is planned in two phases. The first phase is planned for the design of the practical exercises of the course and the production of all backing-up materials. In the second phase the course is offered to participants. Both phases go over into each other, in a pilot's phase with diminished contents the first experiences are already won for the other elaboration and the second course program.
